##Chapter 4 Tip 5 Realm App ##
### Realm is a fast, thread-safe, transactional, object-based database primarily designed for use by mobile devices, with a JavaScript UI.  It also supports encryption, complex querying, UI bindings and more. ###

#### Here we will create a simple database and perform basic operations such as inserting records, updating and deleting.  Most importantly, we will display the records of our schema on the UI. ####

####
Unlike the book, you can create the code in a single App file and you will not have an issue in loading in either Android or iOS
