##React Native Modal with Activity Indicator##
Container of loader full screen modal because donâ€™t want users to be able
to perform any actions on the screen while my data is loading. So I can
go ahead and add that as my only markup for now. In the Modal docs from
React Native, you can see they give us this visible property that
will show and hide as needed.
