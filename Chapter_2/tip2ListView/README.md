Chapter 2
Create a layout to display a list of blog posts

Each post a small card with an image, an excerpt and a button to read more.

Use flex box to arrange the posts on the main container based on the screen size,
so as to handle the screen rotation by properly aligning the cards as landscape
or portrait.

Bug in book.  Need to add horizontal={true} //  or just horizonal to ListView
